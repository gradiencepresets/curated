## New preset process

Presets can be moved from the `curated` status to the [`official`](/official) status. That's the process:

1. The preset should already be in this org. If not, refer to the [new](https://github.com/gradience-presets/new) repo.
2. Open an issue and select the `New preset` template.
3. After opening the preset, the preset will be in review. For being accepted, the preset must be voted by at least 50% of the team.
